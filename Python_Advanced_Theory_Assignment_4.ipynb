    "1. Operator overloading is mostly useful when you're making a new class that falls into an existing \"Abstract Base Class\" (ABC) -- indeed, many of the ABCs in standard library module collections rely on the presence of certain special methods (and special methods, one with names starting and ending with double underscores AKA \"dunders\", are exactly the way you perform operator overloading in Python). This provides good starting guidance.\n",
    "\n",

    "2. For example, a Container class must override special method __contains__, i.e., the membership check operator item in container (as in, if item in container: -- don't confuse with the for statement, for item in container:, which relies on __iter__!-). Similarly, a Hashable must override __hash__, a Sized must override __len__, a Sequence or a Mapping must override __getitem__, and so forth. (Moreover, the ABCs can provide your class with mixin functionality -- e.g., both Sequence and Mapping can provide __contains__ on the basis of your supplied __getitem__ override, and thereby automatically make your class a Container)."
